# introduction

A method to simulate pooled sequencing data (Pool-seq) is implemented in the R language in the package `poolHelper`. The aim of this package is to provide users with a tool to chose the appropriate pool size and depth of coverage when conducting experiments that require pool sequencing. This vignette serves as a introduction, explaining how the different functions of the package can be used to assess the impact of different sequencing parameters.

At the end, we also included a section with details of specific functions. At that section, users can find a detailed step-by-step description of how to simulate Pool-seq data. The various subsections describe how to simulate the total depth of coverage and then partition that coverage among different pools and individuals. There is also a subsection describing how the number of reads with the reference allele can be computed according to the genotype of a given individual.

```{r setup}
library(poolHelper)
```

With the `poolHelper` package, users can evaluate the effect of different pool errors, pool sizes and depths of coverage on the allele frequencies. The frequencies obtained with Pool-seq are compared to the allele frequencies computed directly from genotypes.

# Basic functionality

Briefly, we use `scrm` to simulate a single population at equilibrium and obtain polymorphic sites for each simulated locus. Then, we compute allele frequencies by counting the total number of derived alleles per site and dividing that by the total number of gene copies. After obtaining the allele frequencies computed directly from genotypes, we simulate Pool-seq data and obtain the Pool-seq allele frequencies. Details on this procedure can be found in the last section of this vignette.

We then use the `mae` function from the `Metrics` package to compute the average absolute difference between the Pool-seq allele frequencies and the ones obtained directly from the genotypes. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated as the sum of absolute errors divided by the sample size.

# Pool-seq experimental design

As mentioned, the main goal of the package `poolHelper` is to provide users with a tool to aid in the experimental design of pooled sequencing. Researchers interested in Pool-seq are concerned in obtaining accurate estimates of allelic frequencies, while keeping the costs down. Thus, it is important to have an idea of how accurate the allele frequencies can be when using different pool sizes or sequencing at different mean coverage values. In the following sections we detail how the `poolHelper` package can help users in answering those questions.

## How many pools should I use?

One important aspect to consider is whether DNA extraction should be done using multiple batches of individuals, combining several of them into larger pools for library preparation and sequencing, or using a single batch of individuals. By using the `maePool` function we can check, under different conditions, what is the effect of using multiple or a single batch of individuals.

The `pools` input argument allows the user to simulate a single pool, by creating a list with a single integer or multiple pools, by creating a list with a vector containing various entries. The `maePool` function assumes that each entry of that vector is the size, in number of diploids individuals, of a given pool.

```{r number of pools, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# create a list with a single pool of 100 individuals
pools <- list(100)
# compute average absolute difference between allele frequencies
onePool <- maePool(nDip = 100, nloci = 1000, pools = pools, pError = 100, sError = 0.01, mCov = 100, vCov = 250, min.minor = 0)

# create a list with 10 pools, each with 10 individuals
pools <- list(rep(10, 10))
# compute average absolute difference between allele frequencies
tenPool <- maePool(nDip = 100, nloci = 1000, pools = pools, pError = 100, sError = 0.01, mCov = 100, vCov = 250, min.minor = 0)

# combine both  
final <- rbind(onePool, tenPool)
# convert the number of individuals in the pool to a factor
final$nPools <- as.factor(final$nPools)

# load the ggplot package
library(ggplot2)
# MAE value in the y-axis and the number of individuals in the pool in the x-axis
ggplot(final, aes(x = nPools, y = absError)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()
```

In this example, we can see the effect of using a single or multiple pools when a sample of 100 individuals is sequenced at a mean coverage of 100x and for a given pool error. By varying the `pError` and `mCov` input arguments, users can evaluate the effect of using a single or multiple pools at various pool error values and at different coverages.

## What coverage should I use?

Another fundamental decision is what mean coverage should we try to obtain when sequencing a pool of individuals. By using the `maeFreqs` function we can look at the average absolute difference between genotype allele frequencies and Pool-seq allele frequencies obtained using different mean coverages.

```{r coverage, message=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# create a vector with various mean coverages
mCov <- c(20, 50, 100)
# create a  vector with the variance of the coverage
vCov <- c(100, 250, 500)
# compute average absolute difference between allele frequencies
mydf <- maeFreqs(nDip = 100, nloci = 1000, pError = 100, sError = 0.01, mCov, vCov, min.minor = 0)

# convert the mean coverage into a factor
mydf$mean <- as.factor(mydf$mean)
# boxplot the MAE value in the y-axis and the coverage in the x-axis
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = mean, y = absError)) +
  geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()
```

Note that the `mCov` input argument is a vector with various mean coverage values. The `maeFreqs` function computes the average absolute difference for each user-defined coverage. Additionally, `vCov` should also be a vector, with each entry being the variance of the corresponding coverage in `mCov`. In this example, we can see the effect of sequencing a sample of 100 individuals at 20x, 50x or 100x mean coverage. By varying the `mCov` or `pError` input arguments, users can evaluate the impact of different mean coverages at various pool error values.

## What pool size should I use?

It is also important to define the number of individuals to sequence or, in other words, the pool size. The `maeFreqs` function can also be used to compute the average absolute difference between the allele frequencies computed from genotypes and Pool-seq allele frequencies obtained with different pool sizes.

```{r pool size, message=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# create a vector with various mean coverages
nDip <- c(10, 50, 100)

# compute average absolute difference between allele frequencies
mydf <- maeFreqs(nDip = nDip, nloci = 1000, pError = 100, sError = 0.01, mCov = 100, vCov = 250, min.minor = 0)

# convert the number of individuals into a factor
mydf$nDip <- as.factor(mydf$nDip)
# boxplot the MAE value in the y-axis and the coverage in the x-axis
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = nDip, y = absError)) +
  geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()
```

As you can see, by varying the `nDip` input argument, we can evaluate what is the optimal pool size. In this example, we can see the effect of sequencing a sample of 10, 50 or 100 individuals at 100x coverage. For this coverage and pool error value, it is clear that doubling the pool size, from 50 to 100 individuals, does not lead to a significant decrease in the average absolute difference between allele frequencies. Note that the `maeFreqs` function assumes that only a single pool was used to sequence the population and so, for this example, a single pool of 10, 50 or 100 individuals was used.

## How to test different combinations?

The `maeFreqs` function can also be used to simultaneously test different combinations of parameters. By varying the `mCov`, `pError` and/or `nDip` input arguments, the impact of multiple combinations of those parameters can be quickly assessed. The `maeFreqs` function will simulate all possible combinations of those parameters and compute the average absolute difference between allele frequencies.

```{r}
# create a vector with various mean coverages
mCov <- c(20, 50, 100)
# create a  vector with the variance of the coverage
vCov <- c(100, 250, 500)
# create a vector with various pool errors 
pError <- c(5, 100, 250)

# compute average absolute difference between allele frequencies
mydf <- maeFreqs(nDip = 100, nloci = 1000, pError, sError = 0.01, mCov, vCov, min.minor = 0)

# convert the mean coverage into a factor
mydf$mean <- as.factor(mydf$mean)
# convert the pooling error to a factor
mydf$PoolError <- as.factor(mydf$PoolError)
  
# boxplot the MAE value in the y-axis and the pool error in the x-axis
# producing one boxplot for each of the different coverages
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = PoolError, y = absError, fill = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()
```

In this example, the number of sampled individuals was kept constant, meaning that the population was always sequenced using a pool of 100 individuals. Those 100 individuals were sequenced at 20x, 50x or 100x mean coverage and assuming a pool error value of 5%, 100% or 250%. By selecting multiple combinations of parameters, users can select a sequencing design that minimizes the average absolute difference between allele frequencies or get an idea of how much mismatch to expect in their Pool-seq data.

# Details on specific functions

In this section and until the end of the vignette, we go over the steps required to simulate Pool-seq data and give details on some of the specific functions included in the package.

## Simulate depth of coverage

The `simulateCoverage` function can be used to simulate the total depth of coverage at each site. The `mean` and `variance` input arguments of the function represent, respectively the mean coverage and the variance of the coverage to simulate. `nLoci` represents the number of independent loci to simulate and `nSNPs` is the number of polymorphic sites to simulate per locus.

```{r reads one population}
# simulate number of reads for one population
reads <- simulateCoverage(mean = 50, variance = 250, nSNPs = 100, nLoci = 1)
# display the structure of the reads object
str(reads)
```

As you can see, the resulting output is a list with one entry because `nLoci = 1`. That entry is a vector with `length = 100` because that was the number of `nSNPs`. We can also use this function to simulate the coverage of multiple populations at the same time. To do that, the `mean` and `variance` input arguments of the function should be vectors. The function will assume that each entry of those vectors is the mean and variance of a different population. For instance, in the next example we set `mcov <- c(50, 100)`, meaning that we wish to simulate two populations, the first with a mean coverage of 50x and the second with a mean coverage of 100x.

```{r reads two populations}
# create a vector with the mean coverage of each population
mcov <- c(50, 100)
# create a vector with the variance of the coverage for each population
vcov <- c(250, 500)
# simulate number of reads for two populations
reads <- simulateCoverage(mean = mcov, variance = vcov, nSNPs = 100, nLoci = 1)
# display the structure of the reads object
str(reads)
```

Now, the output of the function is slightly different. We still have a single locus (`nLoci = 1`) and 100 sites on that locus (`nSNPs = 100`) but now that one list entry is a matrix with two rows. Each row is the coverage per site for one population. Thus, the first row is the coverage for the first population of the `mcov` input argument and the second row is the coverage for the second population in that argument. If `mcov` had the mean coverage for more populations, the logic would remain the same.

The difference in the mean coverage of the two population can be quickly visualized. In the following we simulate two populations, one with 50x mean coverage and the other with 100x. We set `nSNPs = 10000` and visualize the coverage distribution using a histogram.

```{r plot reads}
# create a vector with the mean coverage of each population
mcov <- c(50, 100)
# create a vector with the variance of the coverage for each population
vcov <- c(250, 500)
# simulate number of reads for two populations
reads <- simulateCoverage(mean = mcov, variance = vcov, nSNPs = 10000, nLoci = 1)
# plot the coverage of the first population
hist(reads[[1]][1,], col = rgb(0,0,1,1/4), xlim = c(0, 200), main = "", xlab = "")
# add the coverage of the second population
hist(reads[[1]][2,], col = rgb(1,0,0,1/4), add = TRUE)
```

The coverage distribution of the population simulated with a mean of 50x is shown in blue and the distribution of the 100x population is shown in red.

It is also possible to remove sites with low or high coverage by using the `remove_by_reads` function. This function will completely remove any site from the data (in this instance, the site will be removed from both populations). Sites will be removed if their coverage is below the `minimum` allowed or if it is above the `maximum` allowed. In the next bit, we use the `reads` simulated before and remove all sites with a coverage below 25x and above 150x.

```{r remove reads}
# check the minimum and maximum coverage before removal
x <- range(unlist(reads))
# remove sites with coverage below 25x and above 150x
reads <- remove_by_reads(nLoci = 1, reads = reads, minimum = 25, maximum = 150)
# display the structure of the reads object after removal
str(reads)
# check the minimum and maximum coverage after removal
range(unlist(reads))
```

Accordingly, the minimum simulated coverage before running the `remove_by_reads` function was `` `r x[1]` `` and the maximum was `` `r x[2]` `` but after removal of sites with a coverage below 25x and above 150x, the minimum and maximum coverage are, obviously, `` `r range(unlist(reads))[1]` `` and `` `r range(unlist(reads))[2]` `` respectively. It is also clear that we no longer have `nSNPs = 10000` in the data.

## Reads contributed by each pool

It is also possible to simulate the contribution of each pool, assuming that a single population was sequenced using multiple pools. Before computing the actual number of reads contributed by each pool, we first need to simulate the proportion of contribution.

To do this, we use the `poolProbs` function. The `nPools` input argument of this function should represent the number of pools used to sequence the population, while the `vector_np` contains the number of individuals per pool. Thus, in the following example `vector_np = c(10, 10, 10, 10)` means that four pools were used to sequence the population, each comprised of 10 individuals. The `pError` input argument defines the degree of pooling error. Briefly, this pooling error controls the dispersion of the pool contribution, centered around the expected value. Higher values of `pError` lead to a higher dispersion and thus, the contributions will vary more between pools. In other words, with higher values of `pError` some pools will contribute a lot of reads and others will not contribute much.

In the next chunk, we see the difference in proportion of contribution when 4 pools of 10 individuals were used to sequence a single population and the pooling error is either low (`pError = 5`) or high (`pError = 250`). We can also assess the impact of different pool sizes by including one pool with 100 individuals instead of only 10.

```{r probability pool}
# four pools with low sequencing error
poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = c(10, 10, 10, 10), nSNPs = 6, pError = 5)
# four pools with high sequencing error
poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = c(10, 10, 10, 10), nSNPs = 6, pError = 250)
# four pools but one is much larger
poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = c(10, 100, 10, 10), nSNPs = 6, pError = 5)
```

The output of the `poolProbs` function is a matrix with the proportion of contribution for each pool. Each row of the matrix corresponds to a different pool and each column is a different site. You can see that in the first example, the proportion of contribution is roughly the same for all pools. The next example is similar but with `pError = 250`. With this higher pool error, it is clear that some pools have a higher proportion of contribution and others have a smaller. Thus, with higher pool errors, the proportion of contribution is no longer the same for all pools.

This also happens when pool error is low but one of the pools is much larger. In the last example, the second pool has 100 individuals, while the other pools only have 10. In this instance, it is clear the the proportion of contribution of the larger pool is always higher.

After computing the proportion of contribution of each pool, this can be used to simulate the actual number of reads contributed by each pool. To do this, we use the `pReads` function.

This functions requires as input argument the total number of pools used to sequence the population (`nPools`), a vector with the total `coverage` per site and the probabilities of contribution computed with the `poolProbs` function (`probs`). In the next chunk, we simulate coverage for 10 SNPs of a single population, compute the probability of contribution for 4 pools used to sequence that population and then simulate the actual number of reads per pool.

```{r contribution pool low error}
# simulate total coverage per site
reads <- unlist(simulateCoverage(mean = 100, variance = 250, nSNPs = 10, nLoci = 1))
# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = rep(10, 4), nSNPs = 10, pError = 5)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers
pReads <- poolReads(nPools = 4, coverage = reads, probs = probs)
# output the number of reads per pool and per site 
pReads
```

It is clear that, when pool error is quite low (`pError = 5` in the previous chunk), the number of reads contributed by each pool is quite similar. Thus, the total coverage of any given site is well distributed among all pools. On the other hand, if pool error is high (`pError = 250` in the next chunk).

```{r contribution pool high error}
# simulate total coverage per site
reads <- unlist(simulateCoverage(mean = 100, variance = 250, nSNPs = 10, nLoci = 1))
# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = rep(10, 4), nSNPs = 10, pError = 250)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers
pReads <- poolReads(nPools = 4, coverage = reads, probs = probs)
# output the number of reads per pool and per site 
pReads
```

Then the contributions are more uneven. In this instance, there are some sites where one or two pools contribute most of the reads while the remaining pools have few or even zero reads. Thus, the total coverage is not very well distributed among all pools when pool error is higher.

The difference between low or high pool errors can be (roughly) inspected with a histogram. In the next chunk we simulate the total coverage and then use the same coverage to compute the contribution of each pool, using either a low or a high pool error. We then plot the distribution of the number of reads contributed by each pool.

```{r plot pool, tidy=TRUE}
# simulate total coverage per site
reads <- simulateCoverage(mean = 100, variance = 250, nSNPs = 10000, nLoci = 1)
# unlist to create a vector with the coverage
reads <- unlist(reads)

# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = rep(10, 4), nSNPs = 10000, pError = 5)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers
low.pReads <- poolReads(nPools = 4, coverage = reads, probs = probs)

# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = rep(10, 4), nSNPs = 10000, pError = 250)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers
high.pReads <- poolReads(nPools = 4, coverage = reads, probs = probs)

# create the plot of the contribution with low pool error
h1 <- hist(unlist(low.pReads), plot = FALSE)
# create the plot of the contribution with high pool error
h2 <- hist(unlist(high.pReads), plot = FALSE)
# get the maximum x-value from the two plots
xmax <- max(h1[["breaks"]], h2[["breaks"]])
# and the maximum y-value
ymax <- max(h1[["counts"]], h2[["counts"]])
# set the color for the contribution computed with low pool error
col1 <- rgb(0,0,1,1/4)
# set the color for the contribution computed with high pool error
col2 <- rgb(1,0,0,1/4)

# plot the contribution computed with low pool error 
plot(h1, col = col1, xlim = c(0, xmax), ylim = c(0, ymax), main = "", xlab = "")
# add the plot of the contribution computed with high pool error
plot(h2, col = col2, add = TRUE)
```

The distribution of the contribution computed with a low pool error is shown in blue and the distribution computed with a high pool error in red. It is clear that high pool errors lead to more variation in the contribution of each pool towards the total coverage of the population. In particular, the number of pools that contribute zero (or close to zero) reads increases when the pool error is high.

## Reads contributed by each individual

After computing the number of reads contributed by each pool, the next step involves simulating the number of reads contributed by each individual inside their pool. For instance, if a pool of 10 individuals was used to sequence a population, how many reads were contributed by each of those 10 individuals?

As for the pools, the first step requires computing the probability of contribution of each individual. This can be done with the `indProbs` function. This `np` input argument of this function corresponds to the total number of individuals in the pool, while the `nSNPs` is the number of sites to simulate. As before, the `pError` represents the degree of pooling error and higher values of `pError` mean that some individuals will contribute more reads than others.

In the next chunk, we examine the probability of contribution of 10 individuals, sequenced at 6 sites, when pooling error is quite low.

```{r probability individual}
# compute the probability of contribution of each individual
indProbs(np = 10, nSNPs = 6, pError = 5)
```

In this example, the probability of contribution is very similar across individuals. In fact, the probability is around 0.1 for each individual, meaning that, in a situation with low pooling error, all individuals should contribute equally. If we simulate the same conditions, but increasing the pooling error (`pError = 150`) we should see a different result. Note that we change the option so that the output is not printed in scientific notation. This is just to make it easier to visualize the differences and we return to the default settings in the end of the code chunk.

```{r scientific notation}
# apply a penalty to print numeric values in scientific notation
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 5)
# compute the probability of contribution of each individual
indProbs(np = 10, nSNPs = 5, pError = 150)
# return the penalty to the default values
options("scipen" = 0, "digits" = 7)
```

With this higher pooling error, it is evident that the probability of contribution is not the same across all individuals. Some individuals have a much higher probability of contribution while others have a probability of contribution very close to zero.

The probabilities of contribution of each individual can then be used to simulate the total number of reads contributed by each individual, using the `indReads` function. This function requires as input argument the total number of individuals sequenced in that pool (`np`), a vector with the total `coverage` of that particular pool per site and probabilities of contribution computed with the `indProbs` function (`probs`).

In the next chunk, we start by simulating the total coverage per site. This total coverage is then partitioned among the different pools to obtain the total coverage per pool. Finally, we simulate the contribution of the 10 individuals sequenced at one of the pools towards the total coverage of that pool. All these steps are done assuming a low pooling error.

```{r individual reads low error}
# simulate total coverage per site
reads <- unlist(simulateCoverage(mean = 100, variance = 250, nSNPs = 12, nLoci = 1))
# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = rep(10, 4), nSNPs = 12, pError = 5)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers
pReads <- poolReads(nPools = 4, coverage = reads, probs = probs)
# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- indProbs(np = 10, nSNPs = 12, pError = 5)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers of each individual
indReads(np = 10, coverage = pReads[1,], probs = probs)
```

It is clear that, when pool error is low (`pError = 5`), each individual contributes roughly the same number of reads towards the total coverage of the pool. Thus, the overall dispersion is quite low. If we repeat the same steps, changing only the pooling error to a much higher value:

```{r individual reads high error}
# simulate total coverage per site
reads <- unlist(simulateCoverage(mean = 100, variance = 250, nSNPs = 12, nLoci = 1))
# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = rep(10, 4), nSNPs = 12, pError = 150)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers
pReads <- poolReads(nPools = 4, coverage = reads, probs = probs)
# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- indProbs(np = 10, nSNPs = 12, pError = 150)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers of each individual
indReads(np = 10, coverage = pReads[1,], probs = probs)
```

We see that in this instance, there is much more dispersion and the individuals do not contribute the same number of reads. While some individuals do not contribute a single reads towards the total pool coverage, others contribute too many.

## Number of reads with the reference allele

Following the computation of the number of reads contributed by each individual, we should simulate how many of those reads have the reference allele versus how many have the alternative allele. For a single population this can be done using the `computeReference` function.

This function requires as input argument the individual contribution i.e. the number of reads that each individual contributes and the sequencing error - `error`. The sequencing error is defined as a error rate - the higher the error, the more likely it is for an individual that is homozygous for the reference allele (coded as 0 in the `genotypes` matrix) to contribute reads with the alternative allele. Note that this function also requires as input argument the `genotypes` of the individuals. Given that we did not simulate genotypes in this vignette, we are going to create a matrix of genotypes where half the individuals are homozygous for the reference allele and the other half is homozygous for the alternative allele (coded as 2 in the `genotypes` matrix).

In the next chunk we go over all the previous steps, simulating the total coverage for one population, then partitioning that over all pools and computing the contribution of each individual in one of those pools. At the end, we simulate how many of those individually contributed reads have the reference allele.

```{r reference reads}
# simulate total coverage per site
reads <- unlist(simulateCoverage(mean = 100, variance = 250, nSNPs = 12, nLoci = 1))
# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- poolProbs(nPools = 4, vector_np = rep(10, 4), nSNPs = 12, pError = 5)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers
pReads <- poolReads(nPools = 4, coverage = reads, probs = probs)
# compute the proportion of contribution of each pool
probs <- indProbs(np = 10, nSNPs = 12, pError = 5)
# simulate the contribution in actual read numbers of each individual
iReads <- indReads(np = 10, coverage = pReads[1,], probs = probs)
# create fake genotypes - half the matrix is 0 and the other half is 2
geno <- rbind(matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 12), matrix(2, nrow = 5, ncol = 12))
# simulate the number of reference reads
computeReference(genotypes = geno, indContribution = iReads, error = 0.001)
```

There is a clear division between the number of reads with the reference allele for the first 5 individuals (coded as 0 in the `genotypes` matrix) and the remaining 5 individuals (coded as 2 in the `genotypes` matrix). This is expected because the `error` was small. If we increased the `error`, then we would expect to see some reference allele reads contributed by individuals that are homozygous for the other allele.
