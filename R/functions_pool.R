#' Average absolute difference between allele frequencies computed from

#' Calculates the average absolute difference between the allele frequencies

#'
#' Note that this functions allows for different combinations of parameters.

#' Simulate total number of reads per site
#'
#' This function simulates the total number of reads, for each polymorphic site
#' using a negative binomial distribution.
#'
#' The total number of reads is simulated with a negative binomial and according
#' to a user-defined mean depth of coverage and variance. This function is
#' intended to work with a list of genotypes, simulating the depth of coverage
#' for each site present in the genotypes. However, it can also be used to
#' simulate coverage distributions independent of genotypes, by choosing how
#' many loci to simulate (with the `nLoci` option) and choosing how many sites
#' per locus should be simulated (with the `nSNPs` option).
#'
#' @param mean an integer that defines the mean depth of coverage to simulate.
#'   Please note that this represents the mean coverage across all sites. If a
#'   vector is supplied instead, the function assumes that each entry of the
#'   vector is the mean for a different population.
#' @param variance an integer that defines the variance of the depth of coverage
#'   across all sites. If a vector is supplied instead, the function assumes
#'   that each entry of the vector is the variance for a different population.
#' @param genotypes a list of simulated genotypes, where each entry is a matrix
#'   corresponding to a different locus. At each matrix, each column is a
#'   different SNP and each row is a different individual. This is an optional
#'   input but either this or the `nSNPs` must be supplied.
#' @param nSNPs an integer representing the number of polymorphic sites per
#'   locus to simulate. This is an optional input but either this or the
#'   `genotypes` list must be supplied.
#' @param nLoci an optional integer that represents how many independent loci
#'   should be simulated.
#'

#'   entry is a matrix corresponding to a different locus. For each matrix,

#' Calculate population frequency at each SNP
#'
#' The frequency at a given SNP is calculated according to: `pi = c/r`, where c
#' = number of minor-allele reads and r = total number of observed reads.
#'
#' This function takes as input a list that contains the number of reads with
#' the minor allele and the number of total reads per population at a given
#' site. The names of the respective elements of the list should be minor and
#' total. It works with lists containing just one set of minor and total reads,
#' corresponding to a single locus, and with lists where each entry contains a
#' different set of minor and total number of reads, corresponding to different
#' loci.
#'
#' @param listPool a list containing the "minor" element, representing the
#'   number of reads with the minor-allele and the "total" element that contains
#'   information about the total number of Reads. The list should also contain a
#'   "major" entry with the information about reads containing the major-allele.
#'   The output of the `poolPops` function should be used as input here.
#' @param nLoci an integer that represents the total number of independent loci
#'   in the dataset.
#'
#' @return a list with two names entries
#'
#'   \item{pi}{a list with the allele frequencies of each population. Each list
#'   entry is a matrix, corresponding to a different locus. Each row of a matrix
#'   corresponds to a different population and each column to a different site.}
#'
#'   \item{pool}{a list with three different entries: major, minor and total.
#'   This list is similar to the one obtained with the \code{\link{minorPool}}
#'   function.}

#' Randomly select the required number of loci from the pooled sequencing data

#' @param nSims is an integer representing how many types of simulations were
