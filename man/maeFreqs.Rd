\title{Average absolute difference between allele frequencies computed from
genotypes and from Pool-seq data}
\usage{
maeFreqs(nDip, nloci, pError, sError, mCov, vCov, min.minor)
}
\arguments{
\item{nDip}{is an integer or a vector representing the total number of
diploid individuals to simulate. Note that scrm actually simulates
haplotypes, so the number of simulated haplotypes is double of this. If it
is a vector, then each vector entry will be simulated independently. For
instance, if \code{nDip = c(100, 200)}, simulations will be carried out for
samples of 100 and 200 individuals.}

\item{nloci}{is an integer that represents how many independent loci should
be simulated.}

\item{pError}{an integer or a vector representing the value of the error
associated with DNA pooling. This value is related with the unequal
contribution of both individuals and pools towards the total number of
reads observed for a given population - the higher the value the more
unequal are the individual and pool contributions. If it is a vector, then
each vector entry will be simulated independently.}

\item{sError}{a numeric value with error rate associated with the sequencing
and mapping process. This error rate is assumed to be symmetric:
error(reference -> alternative) = error(alternative -> reference). This
number should be between 0 and 1.}

\item{mCov}{an integer or a vector that defines the mean depth of coverage to
simulate. Please note that this represents the mean coverage across all
sites. If it is a vector, then each vector entry will be simulated
independently.}

\item{vCov}{an integer or a vector that defines the variance of the depth of
coverage across all sites. If the \code{mCov} is a vector, then \code{vCov}
should also be a vector, with each entry corresponding to the variance of
the respective entry in the \code{mCov} vector. Thus, the first entry of
the \code{vCov} vector will be the variance associated with the first entry
of the \code{mCov} vector.}

\item{min.minor}{is an integer representing the minimum allowed number of
minor-allele reads. Sites that, across all populations, have less
minor-allele reads than this threshold will be removed from the data.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with columns detailing the number of diploid
individuals, the pool error, the number of pools, the number of individuals
per pool, the mean coverage, the variance of the coverage and the average
absolute difference between the frequencies computed from genotypes and
from pooled data.
}
\description{
Calculates the average absolute difference between the allele frequencies
computed directly from genotypes and from pooled sequencing data.
}
\details{
The average absolute difference is computed with the \link[Metrics]{mae}
function, assuming the frequencies computed directly from the genotypes as
the \code{actual} input argument and the frequencies from pooled data as the
\code{predicted} input argument.

Note that this functions allows for different combinations of parameters.
Thus, the effect of different combinations of parameters on the average
absolute difference can be tested. For instance, it is possible to check what
is the effect of different coverages by including more than one value in the
\code{mCov} input argument. This function will run and compute the average
absolute difference for all combinations of the \code{nDip}, \code{pError}
and \code{mCov} input arguments. This function assumes that a single pool of
size \code{nDip} was used to sequence the population.
