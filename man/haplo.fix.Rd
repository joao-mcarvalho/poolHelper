\title{Create invariable sites on the scrm output}
\usage{
haplo.fix(haplotypes, nHap)
}
\arguments{
\item{haplotypes}{a list of haplotypes obtained from the simulations done
with scrm. Each entry of the list is a matrix that corresponds to a given
locus. At each matrix, each column is a different site and each row is a
different haplotype.}

\item{nHap}{an integer representing the total number of haplotypes simulated.}
}
\value{
a list of haplotypes identical to \code{haplotypes}, but without empty
loci.
}
\description{
This function applies a correction for the situations where scrm does not
produce a single polymorphic site for a given locus. In this situation, two
artificial sites are created at that locus. All individuals are assumed to be
homozygous for the reference allele at those sites.
