\title{Create VCF file from Pool-seq data}
\usage{
pool2vcf(reference, alternative, total, file, pos = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference}{is a list where each entry corresponds to a different locus.
Each list entry is a vector with the number of reads with the reference
allele. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different SNP. This list
can have a single entry if the data is comprised of a single locus.}

\item{alternative}{is a list where each entry corresponds to a different
locus. Each list entry is a vector with the number of reads with the
alternative allele. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different
SNP. This list can have a single entry if the data is comprised of a single
locus.}

\item{total}{is a list where each entry corresponds to a different locus.
Each list entry is a vector with the total number of reads observed at each
SNP. Each entry of the vector corresponds to a different SNP. This list can
have a single entry if the data is comprised of a single locus.}

\item{file}{is a character string naming the file to write to.}

\item{pos}{is an optional input (default is NULL). If the actual position of
the SNPs are known, they can be used as input here. When working with a
single locus, this should be a numeric vector with each entry corresponding
to the position of each SNP. If the data has multiple loci, this should be
a list where each entry is a numeric vector with the position of the SNPs
for a different locus.}
}
\value{
a file in the current working directory containing Pool-seq data in
the VCF format.
}
\description{
Creates and saves a file with the information from Pool-seq data coded in the
VCF format.
}
\details{
It starts by converting the number of reads with the \code{reference} allele,
the \code{alternative} allele and the \code{total} depth of coverage to a
R,A:DP string. R is the number of reads of the reference allele, A is the
number of reads of the alternative allele and DP is the total depth of
coverage.

Then, this information coded as R,A:DP is combined with other necessary
information such as the chromosome of each SNP, the position of the SNP and
the quality of the genotype among others. This creates a data frame where
each row corresponds to a different SNP.

A \code{file} is then created and saved in the current working directory,
with the header lines that go above the table in a VCF file. Finally, the
data frame is appended to that file.
